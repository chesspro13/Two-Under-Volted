# Two-Under-Volted

Using two 750 watt hub motors, create a smart E-Bike that is fun to use and commute to work with.

Goals:
	> Speed Sensor
	> Read and display battery voltage and current draw
	> Calculate and display range
	> Stop lights/turn signals/hazards
	> Finer throttle control
	> Send data to phone via bluetooth

Thing to consider
	> Use throttle and an accumpanying button to set different paramaters
	> ABS

Parts:
	> Front hub motor
	> Rear hub motor
	> Bike frame
	> 2x ESC
	> Battery pack
	> Emergency stop button
	> Relays

TODO: 
	> Make a battery
	> Figure out how throttle communicates to ESC
